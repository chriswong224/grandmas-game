Game Play Description:
Grandmas Game Solitaire Grandma's Game is a simple game with unusual card movement. 

The game is played with two decks of cards. There are eight foundations, four that start with aces and four that start with kings. You stack the foundations in numerical order in the same suit, either ascending or descending. 

There are 13 tableau piles. Each contains several cards at the start of the game. Before you start playing the two decks of cards are dealt to the tableau. One card is dealt to each pile, then the deal continues back at the first pile. Any time a king is dealt, the next card goes back onto the deck pile in the upper left. After the 5th, 10th and 13th piles get their card, one card also goes to the deck pile. 

Also, if a card is dealt that has a number that matches the number of the tableau pile, then the next card also goes to the deck. So if an 8 is dealt to the 8th pile, the next card goes to the deck. This fills the deck pile with a variable number of extra cards. 

You can move the top card from any tableau pile to the foundations. Click the deck pile to turn over one card. 

In addition, the number of the card will cause all of the cards from the corresponding pile to spread out below the tableau. So if you get a 4 from the deck, then the 4th tableau pile will spread out. You can play the card from the deck or any of the cards in the spread to the foundations. Click the deck again and all of the cards from the spread will return to the tableau pile. 

In addition the previous deck card will be placed under them in the tableau. You can also re-arrange the cards in the spread by swapping any two cards. Swap them as much as you like to affect the order in which they will be returned to the tableau. Continue playing until you have run through the deck or the foundations are full.
